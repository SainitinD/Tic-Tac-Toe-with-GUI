## Tic Tac Toe by Sainitin D
This is my implementation of tic tac toe using python, pygame and tkinter. I created this a while ago to get familiar with python and make something along the way. I created and added all of the UI/visuals for a good user experience. Also, all of the project has been thoroughly commented so feel free to take a look.

There are two different modes for this game. You can either play with a CPU or play with another player :))
